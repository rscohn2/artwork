## About this artwork

This repo hosts artwork for the [Unified Acceleration Foundation](https://uxlfoundation.org) and its hosted projects. Before you use this artwork, please be aware that it is subject to the [Trademark Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage) of the Linux Foundation.

You should take the time to read and understand the [Trademark Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage), as it will help you to understand the situations in which you can use the marks without asking, and when you need to ask for permission.

The [Trademark Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage) is designed to strike a balance between enabling project communities to use them and protecting their value. For a list of marks covered by the [Trademark Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage), please see the [Trademark List](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademarks). If you have questions, please reach out to [trademark@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:trademark@linuxfoundation.org).

## Preparing artwork for contribution

If you plan to contribute artwork, please help us keep things consistent and organized by following these basic guidelines:

- Plain `.svg` is the preferred file format. Please start with this. We can help you convert `.ai`, `.eps`, or (in some cases) `.pdf` files.
- `.png` is preferred for non-vector images. We can help you convert your `.svg` to `.png` if need be. Please scale it to 500px in one dimension, at minimum.
- To the greatest extent possible, please try to trim whitespace around the image.

Please follow this naming convention: `project_name/project_name-type-orientation-color-background.filetype`

- `project_name`: lower case, convert spaces to underscores
- `type`: `icon` or `logo`, where the logo generally includes the icon and some text.
- `orientation`: for logos, `horizontal` or `stacked`
- `color`: the color of the image itself, e.g., `color`, `black`, `white`, `grayscale`
- `background`: optional, use `dark_background` for images with a color icon and white text

Pull requests welcomed!
